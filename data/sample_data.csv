N/A","She has had bad stinky gas for days. Eating grass and puked.
","The symptoms you're describing in your Portuguese Podengo Pequeno, such as persistent bad gas, eating grass, vomiting, and diarrhea with a greenish color, could be indicative of gastrointestinal upset. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including dietary indiscretion (eating something she shouldn't have), an intolerance or allergy to certain foods, infections, or even stress.

Given that these symptoms have persisted for several days, it's important to address her diet first. Ensure that she is on a well-balanced, easily digestible diet. Sometimes, a bland diet for a few days, consisting of boiled chicken and rice, can help settle an upset stomach. Make sure she has constant access to fresh water to stay hydrated, especially since she's experiencing diarrhea and vomiting.

Since she's not currently on any medications and doesn't have a history of medical conditions, it's less likely that these symptoms are a side effect of treatment or an ongoing illness. However, it's important to consider that if she's been exposed to any new foods, treats, or even plants, this could be the cause of her gastrointestinal distress.

For the grass eating, this is a common behavior in dogs that have an upset stomach. They may do this to induce vomiting and relieve their discomfort. However, frequent vomiting can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, so it's important to monitor her closely.

To help with the gas, you might consider a probiotic supplement designed for dogs, which can help restore healthy gut bacteria and aid digestion. However, it's important to choose a product that's specifically formulated for canines.

In terms of when to seek immediate veterinary care, watch for signs of worsening condition such as increased lethargy, a bloated abdomen, continuous vomiting where she can't keep water down, or if the diarrhea becomes very frequent or contains blood. Additionally, if she shows signs of pain, such as whining or reluctance to move, this would also warrant a prompt visit to the hospital.

Keep her environment calm and avoid any unnecessary stress, which can exacerbate gastrointestinal issues. Make sure she's not getting into anything she shouldn't, like the trash or table scraps, which could be contributing to her symptoms.

If you notice any of the more severe symptoms mentioned, or if her condition doesn't improve over the next day or two with the supportive care at home, it would be wise to have her examined by a professional.

N/A","Hey, Like spray shits diarrhea. Every time he goes to the bathroom and he just seems sick.","Diarrhea in a 3-month-old Pyrenean Shepherd puppy can be concerning, especially when accompanied by lethargy, sneezing, and itching. These symptoms can be indicative of a range of issues, from dietary indiscretions to infections or parasites.

The fact that the diarrhea is brown and not bloody or black is somewhat reassuring, as it may suggest that there is no severe bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. However, the frequency and persistence of the diarrhea, along with the lethargy, suggest that your puppy's body is under stress and is trying to fight off whatever is causing the illness.

Given the age of your puppy and the absence of a vaccination history, we need to consider the possibility of viral infections such as parvovirus, which can be serious and require immediate veterinary care. However, common causes of diarrhea in puppies also include dietary issues such as eating something they shouldn't have, a sudden change in diet, or food intolerance. Intestinal parasites are another common cause, and without regular deworming, this could be a concern.

For the sneezing and itching, these could be signs of allergies or a respiratory infection. Allergies can also cause gastrointestinal upset in some cases.

Here's what you can do to help your puppy:

1. Ensure your puppy has access to clean, fresh water at all times to prevent dehydration.
2. Temporarily withhold food for 12-24 hours to allow the gastrointestinal tract to settle, then reintroduce a bland diet such as boiled chicken and rice in small, frequent meals.
3. Keep your puppy in a clean, comfortable, and warm environment to help reduce stress and promote recovery.
4. Monitor your puppy's stool consistency, frequency, and overall behavior very closely.

In the current condition, if you notice any of the following symptoms, it would be necessary to seek immediate veterinary attention:

- Persistent vomiting along with diarrhea, as this can quickly lead to dehydration.
- If the diarrhea becomes bloody or black, indicating potential bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract.
- Signs of severe lethargy or unresponsiveness, which can indicate a serious underlying condition.
- If your puppy's abdomen seems bloated or painful to the touch, as this could suggest a more serious gastrointestinal issue.

Remember, puppies have a limited ability to fight off infections and can deteriorate quickly, so prompt attention to changes in their condition is crucial.

N/A","yellow diarrhea, yellow/foamy vomit, slightly decreased appetite","The symptoms you're describing in your Chihuahua, such as yellow diarrhea, yellow/foamy vomit, and a slightly decreased appetite, could be indicative of several underlying issues. The yellow coloration in both the vomit and diarrhea suggests that there may be an excess of bile, which can occur if your dog is vomiting on an empty stomach or if there is a rapid transit of food through the intestines. The presence of fleas can also contribute to general malaise and gastrointestinal upset if there is a flea-related allergy or if your dog has ingested fleas leading to internal parasites like tapeworms.

In this situation, it's important to ensure that your dog stays hydrated, as vomiting and diarrhea can lead to dehydration. Offer small amounts of water frequently, and you can also provide an electrolyte solution specifically designed for dogs to help maintain hydration. It's also advisable to withhold food for 12-24 hours to allow the gastrointestinal tract to rest. After this period, you can introduce a bland diet, such as boiled chicken and rice, in small, frequent meals. This can help to settle the stomach and firm up the stools.

Since your dog is not currently on any medications and has no history of medical conditions, it's important to monitor for any changes in behavior or worsening of symptoms. If the vomiting and diarrhea continue despite these measures, or if your dog becomes lethargic, has a significant decrease in appetite, or shows signs of abdominal pain or bloating, these would be indications that you should seek immediate veterinary care.

Additionally, while you are using shampoo and home remedies for flea and tick prevention, it might be worth considering a more comprehensive flea control program, as fleas can cause not only discomfort but also more serious health issues if not effectively managed.

Keep a close eye on your dog's overall condition, and if there's any doubt about her health or if the symptoms persist, it would be prudent to have her evaluated by a professional. Remember, prompt attention to gastrointestinal issues is important to prevent dehydration and other complications.

N/A",She only had bad orangish diarhea one day. The next day she would not eat anything and she just layed around yesterday i noticed her bresthing was shallow still not eating and laying around. Today shes wheezing and wont walk and she looks a little swollen,"The initial occurrence of orange diarrhea could have been caused by a variety of factors, including dietary indiscretion, infections, or even systemic diseases. The progression to lethargy, loss of appetite, and shallow breathing suggests that the condition is affecting her more systemically and is not just gastrointestinal.

Given the age of your dog, we must consider age-related diseases that can manifest with these symptoms, such as kidney or liver disease, which can cause gastrointestinal upset and changes in drinking and urination habits. The shallow breathing and wheezing you've noticed are particularly concerning, as they could indicate respiratory distress or heart disease, which is not uncommon in older dogs.

The swelling you've observed could be due to fluid accumulation, which can happen with heart failure or other conditions that cause poor circulation or low protein levels in the blood. The fact that she is unwilling to walk could be due to weakness, pain, or a combination of both.

In this situation, it's important to keep her comfortable and try to encourage her to drink small amounts of water to prevent dehydration. If she is willing to eat, offer her a bland diet, such as boiled chicken and rice, in small portions. However, do not force her to eat or drink if she is resistant, as this could cause additional stress.

Please be aware that if you notice any of the following symptoms, it would be critical to seek immediate veterinary attention: extreme lethargy to the point of not responding, pale or blue-tinged gums, collapse, or any signs of pain such as whining or restlessness. These could be signs of a life-threatening emergency.

Remember, these are supportive measures, but given the severity and progression of her symptoms, it is imperative to have her evaluated by a veterinarian as soon as possible.

N/A","I just noticed it today,but we have moved and this was hard on him because my son has an Aussie doodle and me and chewy raised her and trained her and we lived with my son for the last 2 or 4 years He used to eat Everytime I feed peeper ,just cause he is stingy.But ever since it's just me and him and we have always been alright on our own.Something is different this time he seems so depressed and just not interested in anything even eating.He has the saggy belly now and haven't been gone 2 or three weeks.Im really worried.??He's never not been by my side please tell me I'm just being overly cautious.not sure if that's the word I'm looking for.He was my emotional support animal and if that might help on the shots hes had .I can call Pullman WA vet when they open if that will help Thank you","It sounds like your dog is experiencing a significant change in his environment and routine, which can lead to stress-related behaviors such as depression and a lack of appetite. The fact that he has a saggy belly and has had a recent episode of diarrhea that was bloody or black is concerning and could indicate a serious health issue, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or an infection.

Given the symptoms you've described, it's important to ensure he stays hydrated, as diarrhea can lead to dehydration quickly, especially if he's not eating well. Offer him small amounts of water frequently and watch if he's drinking. You can also try to entice him to eat by offering a bland diet, such as boiled chicken and rice, which can be easier on his stomach than his regular food.

Stress can exacerbate underlying health issues, so creating a calm environment for him is crucial. Keep his surroundings quiet, maintain a routine, and provide him with comfortable bedding and his favorite toys. Gentle interaction and reassurance from you can also help alleviate his anxiety.

However, the presence of bloody or black stool is a red flag and warrants immediate veterinary attention. This could be a sign of internal bleeding or other serious conditions that require prompt treatment. If you notice any of the following symptoms, it's critical to take him to the hospital:

- Persistent vomiting, especially if it's bloody or looks like coffee grounds.
- Increased lethargy or unresponsiveness.
- Pale gums, which can indicate anemia or significant blood loss.
- Difficulty breathing or rapid breathing.
- A distended or painful abdomen.

These symptoms can indicate a potentially life-threatening situation, and he should be evaluated by a veterinarian as soon as possible.

In the meantime, keep a close eye on his behavior and bowel movements. If his condition worsens or he shows any of the symptoms mentioned above, do not hesitate to seek veterinary care immediately.
